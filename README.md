# sWJz4Chess

In the works, creating a new Chess Board and way to Play...

starting to write this in Pygame, any persons out there want to help create this game?

where I'm at with this, at this time...

board drawn
mouse icon
simple chess pieces made
chess pieces are at there starting point on the board
have the moves made partially for one knight.

what needs to be done:

making the possible moves for all pieces on the board.

making a timer.

making a touch this piece and take away that piece feature, by placing pieces off the board, but in window.

contact me through @github.com

Looking for a few individuals that would like to work on this project with me through the internet for free.

See what happens.

Name is, Shawn.
