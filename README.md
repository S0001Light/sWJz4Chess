# sWJ_z4Chess

date started on github.com 11-13-2021

In the works, creating a new Chess Board and way to Play...

the different way to play the game would be, at the start, where pawns - at start, move 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 moves, then each side, start moving as regular chess.

starting to write this in Pygame, any individuals out there want to help create this game?

Program Requirements:

python 3
pygame - Latest

__________

where I'm at with this, at this time...

board drawn
mouse icon
simple chess pieces made
chess pieces are at there starting point on the board
have the moves made partially for one knight.

what needs to be done:

making the possible moves for all pieces on the board.

making a timer.

making a touch this piece and take away that piece feature, by placing pieces off the board, but in window.

contact me through @github.com or on this project page discussion board.

Looking for a few 2 to 4, individuals that would like to work on this project with me through the internet for free.

See what happens.

Name is, Shawn.
